<p align="center">Quickstart kit for emulating PS3 on Linux systems with RPCS3.</p>

# Requirement

In general, you will successfully download RPCS3 and PS3 Firmware from [RPCS3 official site](https://rpcs3.net/).

If not, please download the **[Starter Kit](https://github.com/Vincent-the-gamer/linux-rpcs3-quickstart/releases/tag/kit)** first. This kit is made for someone who has problem downloading from the official site.

The kit contains:

1. RPCS3 Linux AppImage v0.0.30
2. PS3 Firmware Version 4.90 (Named **`PS3UPDAT.PUP`**)

If the kit is outdated, please raise an issue.

# RPCS3 Installation Tutorial

> [!NOTE]
> These 2 following videos are the same.

Bilibili: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1sy421z73r](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1sy421z73r)

YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk7BRcrIOfM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk7BRcrIOfM)

The videos demonstrated the installation on a **`Steam Deck(Steam OS)`**, but it's also **`Linux`**, so you can follow the process to install RPCS3 on **`ANY`** Linux distribution.

Btw I've installed it on my Arch Linux mini PC and Steam Deck, and they both works well.
